This project fetches latest releases of custom roms, recoveries and kernels from @RM6Updates, the official Telegram Channel for Realme 6 Series, and updates them on this website. The amazing part is that it's fully automatic!

The sole aim of this project is to help out the users of Realme 6 to easily find and download custom firmware for their device.
